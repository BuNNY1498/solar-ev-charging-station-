 Final year project - Design and Simulation of a Solar-Powered Electric Car Charging Station
# ☀️🚗 Solar-Powered Electric Vehicle Charging Station

This repository contains the final year B.E. project titled **"Design and Simulation of a Solar-Powered Electric Car Charging Station"** by *Phani Kumar* from **Jansons Institute of Technology**.

The project focuses on designing a sustainable electric vehicle (EV) charging station powered by solar energy. The system uses **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)** for efficient solar energy extraction, a **boost converter** for power regulation, and **Arduino-based control** for real-time implementation and validation.
